title: "Organization-level Metrics and Models"
---

This dashboard presents metrics and models for each repository within both the
[`epiverse-trace`](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) and
[`reconhub`](https://github.com/reconhub) GitHub organizations. It is intended
to demonstrate the kinds of analyses and insights that are possible. It is
intended to change and develop a lot. Please provide feedback via GitHub by
clicking on the symbol on the top right.

The dashboard currently has three main pages:

1. An [organization maintenance](./chaoss-org.html) page identifying
   maintenance priorities across all repositories.
2. [*Community Models*](./models.html) summarising scores for the various
    [CHAOSS (*Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software*)
    models](https://chaoss.community/kb-metrics-and-metrics-models/) for each
    repository.
3. A [network diagram](./network.html) of strengths of relationship between
   each repository.
