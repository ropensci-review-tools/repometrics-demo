<p>This page identifies maintenance priorities for a selected repository, in terms of both <a href="https://chaoss.community/kbtopic/all-metrics-models/">CHAOSS models</a>, and the individual <a href="https://chaoss.community/kbtopic/all-metrics/">CHAOSS metrics</a> which comprise those models. In its present state, this is mostly a proof-of-concept, and is not as well developed as the accompanying <a href="./org.html"><em>Organizational Maintenance</em> page</a>.</p>
<p>The “Outliers only” selector immediate below determines whether values shown for both models and metrics are outliers only (default of “true”), or whether all values are shown (“false”).</p>
