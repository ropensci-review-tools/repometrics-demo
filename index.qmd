title: "Organization-level Metrics and Models"
---

This dashboard presents metrics and models for each repository within both the
[`epiverse-trace`](https://github.com/epiverse-trace) and
[`reconhub`](https://github.com/reconhub) GitHub organizations. It is intended
to demonstrate the kinds of analyses and insights that are possible. It is
intended to change and develop a lot. Please provide feedback via GitHub by
clicking on the symbol on the top right.

The dashboard currently has three main pages:

1. An [organization maintenance](./chaoss-org.html) page identifying
   maintenance priorities across all repositories.
2. A [repository maintenance](./chaoss-repo.html) page providing additional
   detail on maintenance needs of a selected repository.
3. A [*Community Health*](./models.html) summarising scores for the various
   [CHAOSS (*Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software*)
    models and
    metrics](https://chaoss.community/kb-metrics-and-metrics-models/) for each
    repository.

There is also an additional [network diagram page](./network.html), showing
strengths of relationship between each repository.
