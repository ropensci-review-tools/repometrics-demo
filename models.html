<p>The <a href="./org.html"><em>Organizational Maintenance</em></a> and <a href="./repo.html"><em>Repository Maintenance</em></a> pages provide various insights into maintenance deficits and needs across the whole organization and within individual repositories. This page provides more detail on the various <a href="https://chaoss.community/kb-metrics-and-metrics-models/">CHAOSS (<em>Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software</em>) models</a> used to generate values shown on those two pages. Each of these conceptual models aggregates various individual metrics, and aims to synthesise prominent aspects of community health. This page provides insights into a range of those models, assessed for each repository in the <code>epiverse-trace</code> and <code>reconhub</code> GitHub organizations. Details of individual metrics can be seen on the <a href="./repo.html"><em>Repository Maintenance</em> page</a>.</p>
<section id="aggregate-community-health" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aggregate-community-health">Aggregate Community Health</h2>
<p>This page shows aggregate community health scores for all repositories within the <code>reconhub</code> and <code>epiverse-trace</code> organizations. Higher values describe repositories with greater community health scores. Values for individual models are standardised across all repositories to have mean values of zero and standard deviations of one. These results are aggregated across thirteen distinct models, leading to maximal aggregated values slightly exceeding that value.</p>
